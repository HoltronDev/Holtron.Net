# Holtron.Net
This is an updated version of the [Lidgren Gen3 Networking](https://github.com/lidgren/lidgren-network-gen3) library.

I'd used the original a few times, but started getting limited because it was stuck in .NET Framework 4.6. So I decided to bring it to .NET 6+ and then have been workin' on getting it updated with some newer stuff from the newer versions of .NET.

Another purpose of this is to add unit and integration testing over time to make this more stable as things get added and improved upon. I'd also like to get this into a state that it could be integrated into other C# based engines without a bunch of extra crap involved.

*THIS IS NOT IN A FINAL STATE AT THE MOMENT, USE AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION*

# Examples
- [Basic Client](https://github.com/HoltronDev/Holtron.Net/tree/master/Holtron.Net.Examples/Holtron.Net.Examples.BasicClient)
- [Basic Server](https://github.com/HoltronDev/Holtron.Net/tree/master/Holtron.Net.Examples/Holtron.Net.Examples.BasicServer)
- More will be added as we have time and examples made.

# Games that use Holtron.Net
Currently none, but I'm personally workin' on a game that utilizes this.

# Other
This will get filled out more as time goes along, hey, maybe I'll even make this halfway usable. For now, your best bet is to check out the example folders for how to get things running, but I'll update it more as time allows.
